    <h3 class="project_name"><a href="https://github.com/CSJIII/Old-Resume">Old Web Resume</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Old website version of my current resume that I made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Ended up being too simple for my tastes but I loved that I learned a lot about CSS while working on this 
        project and learned how to use premade icons from sources like fontawesome.com.</li>
      <li>Utilized JavaScript to create three different widgets that will change the background when clicked.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="project_name"><a href="https://github.com/CSJIII/Resume">Responsive Designed Web Resume</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>New version of my resume website that utilizes Responsive Web Design and makes better use of 
        Semantic HTML and HTML comments to make a slightly more complex web resume with much better user interface formatting and much prettier-looking, better-organized code.</li>
      <li>Utilized JavaScript to add a fourth widget that will change the background back to the default color 
        when clicked and implemented a fully functional real-time clock.</li>
      <li>Currently working on using Python and Django to make a CRUD app version of this web resume.</li>
    </ul>
